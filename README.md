# AWS
In this repository I'm going to share my journey of preparation for the 2026 SpainSkills competition.
For said competition, I'm using AWS Jam and AWS Academy. The notes are in Spanish, mainly due to how the competition shaped up it's rules, and didn't give a clear outline to follow. 

The showcased content belongs to AWS, and the notes are merely educational, not a distribution of the courses of AWS.
